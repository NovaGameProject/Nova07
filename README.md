# Nova Game Engine

Nova is a community-focused, open-source game engine built in C++20. It is designed to capture the soul and aesthetic of the "classic" era of online building games (2007), while utilizing modern reflection and rendering techniques.

## 🌟 The Vision
Nova is born out of a desire to return to a simpler, community-driven platform, that ROBLOX used to be back in the day. We are here to preserve the aesthetics, but provide modern tooling to support modern developers using our game engine!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++20
- **Reflection:** [reflect-cpp](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp)
- **Rendering, input and window management:** [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)

## 🚀 Getting Started
We will add these later... coming soon

Very WIP! Only reflection and basic 2007 RBXL parsing.
